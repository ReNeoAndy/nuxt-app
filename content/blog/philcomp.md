The Philosophy of Computing Research Group is Cool!

Welcome to a space where the mind meets the machine! The Research Group on Philosophy of Computing is dedicated to diving deep into the most fundamental questions about computation—and trust us, it's fascinating.

This group isn't just about algorithms and code; it's about exploring the philosophical foundations of computing itself. We investigate everything from the theoretical bedrock of computation to its wide-ranging epistemological, ethical, and social implications. Think: What does it mean to "compute"? How does technology change what we know and how we act?

Born out of dynamic academic meetings in 2022 and 2023, this group is a continuation of a vibrant intellectual community. Our commitment is to the production of essential philosophical and scientific knowledge.
